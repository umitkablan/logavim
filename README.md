# Log-a-Vim
-------------

Plugin to filter out unnecessary repeaded sections of a log file and make it more convenient to read.

How to Install

How to Use
----------
Open a log file and type `:Logalize` to create a new filtered readonly buffer from the contents of the current log buffer.
The filtered-out characters of the cursor line will be shown on the command line so you'd have the dirty sections like date and log level both away from your eye and acessible.
